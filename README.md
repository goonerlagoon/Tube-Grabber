# Tube Grabber
Small script for automating YouTube downloads via @yt-dlp.

~~Will add the ability to delete videos via the YouTube API after they're downloaded from a playlist in the future.~~ Opted to use yt-dlp's 'download_archive' option to achieve similar functionality instead.


May also add the ability to pass switches and arguments into the script at runtime. 
I'll see how useful that particular feature will be as I peruse the script.
