# tubegrabber
Small personal script for automating YouTube downloads via youtube-dlp.

Will add the ability to delete videos via the YouTube API after they're downloaded from a playlist in the future.

May also add the ability to pass switches and arguments into the script at runtime. 
I'll see how useful that particular feature will be as I peruse the script.
